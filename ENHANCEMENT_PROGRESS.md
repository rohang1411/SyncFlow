# SyncFlow Enhancements - Implementation Progress

## Status: IN PROGRESS

### Completed Tasks

#### ✅ Task 1: Create FolderMapping Model and Update TransferProfile
- Created `FolderMapping.cs` model with source→destination mapping
- Updated `TransferProfile` to use `List<FolderMapping>` instead of separate lists
- Added migration logic to convert old format to new format
- Updated `IsValid()` and `GetValidationErrors()` methods
- Added `IsDuplicate()` method for profile comparison
- Updated `ProfileRepository` to handle migration on load and import
- **Files Created**: `SyncFlow/Models/FolderMapping.cs`
- **Files Modified**: `SyncFlow/Models/TransferProfile.cs`, `SyncFlow/Repositories/ProfileRepository.cs`

#### ✅ Task 2: Create Modern Dialog System
- Created `ModernDialogWindow.xaml` with Fluent Design and Mica backdrop
- Implemented Success, Error, Warning, Info, and Confirmation dialogs
- Updated `IDialogService` with new methods (ShowSuccess, ShowConfirmation, SelectFile, SaveFile)
- Updated `DialogService` to use modern dialogs
- **Files Created**: `SyncFlow/Views/ModernDialogWindow.xaml`, `SyncFlow/Views/ModernDialogWindow.xaml.cs`
- **Files Modified**: `SyncFlow/Services/IDialogService.cs`, `SyncFlow/Services/DialogService.cs`

#### ✅ Task 3: Implement Real-time Progress Updates
- Added progress throttling (100ms minimum interval) to TransferService
- Updated TransferService to work with FolderMappings
- Added BytesTransferred, TransferSpeed, TimeElapsed to TransferProgress
- Implemented CalculateSpeed method
- Added Stopwatch for accurate timing
- **Files Modified**: `SyncFlow/Services/TransferService.cs`, `SyncFlow/Models/TransferProgress.cs`

#### ✅ Task 4: Update Profile Editor for Folder Mappings
- Completely redesigned ProfileEditorWindow with Fluent Design
- Implemented folder mapping UI (source→destination pairs)
- Added Add/Remove mapping functionality
- Updated validation for folder mappings
- Modern card-based layout for mappings
- **Files Modified**: `SyncFlow/Views/ProfileEditorWindow.xaml`, `SyncFlow/Views/ProfileEditorWindow.xaml.cs`

### Next Steps

The following tasks need to be implemented in order:

2. Create Modern Dialog System
3. Implement Real-time Progress Updates
4. Update Profile Editor for Folder Mappings
5. Implement Folder Verification Feature
6. Fix Settings Window Scrolling
7. Fix Reset Button Functionality
8. Implement Profile Import/Export
9. Add Configurable Storage Location
10. Implement Duplicate Profile Detection
11. Add Glass Effect Support
12. Ensure Profile Persistence
13. Update Transfer Service for Folder Mappings
14. UI Polish and Modernization
15. Comprehensive Testing and Bug Fixes
16. Documentation Updates

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: The TransferProfile model has changed significantly:
- Old: `SourceFolders` (List<string>) + `DestinationFolder` (string)
- New: `FolderMappings` (List<FolderMapping>)
- Migration is automatic when loading profiles
- Old properties are marked as `[Obsolete]` for backward compatibility

### Files That Need Updates

Due to the TransferProfile model change, the following files will need updates:

- ❌ `ProfileEditorWindow.xaml` and `.xaml.cs` - UI for editing folder mappings
- ❌ `TransferService.cs` - Transfer logic for folder mappings
- ❌ `VerificationService.cs` - Verification logic for folder mappings
- ❌ `ProfileViewModel.cs` - Display logic for folder mappings
- ❌ `MainWindow.xaml` - Display of profile information

### Current Build Status

✅ No compilation errors
✅ Models updated successfully
✅ Repository updated successfully
⚠️ Services and Views need updates to work with new model
