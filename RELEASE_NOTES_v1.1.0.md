## üì± Smartphone Support Status

### Current Limitations
- **MTP Device Access:** Standard .NET file dialogs cannot directly browse MTP devices (Android phones)
- This is a platform limitation, not a bug
- Windows Explorer can see phones because it uses Shell COM interfaces

### Workaround Available
Users can access smartphone files using these methods:

**Method 1: Copy to PC First (Recommended)**
1. Connect phone via USB in "File Transfer" mode
2. Copy files from phone to PC folder using Windows Explorer
3. Use SyncFlow to organize/backup from PC folder

**Method 2: Map Phone as Network Drive**
- Use third-party tools (AirDroid, WebDAV Drive)
- Map phone as drive letter
- Access through SyncFlow normally

**Method 3: Use Robocopy Script**
- Robocopy can access MTP devices directly
- Create batch script for automation
- See `SMARTPHONE_WORKAROUND_GUIDE.md` for details

### Future Plans
- Full MTP support planned for v2.0.0
- Will implement Windows Portable Device (WPD) API
- Custom folder browser with Shell COM interfaces
- Estimated timeline: 2-3 weeks
