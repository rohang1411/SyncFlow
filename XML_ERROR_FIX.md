# XML Parsing Error Fix

## Error
```
Severity: Error (active)
Code: MC3000
Description: 'An error occurred while parsing EntityName. Line 266, position 50.' XML is not valid.
Project: SyncFlow
File: C:\Users\rohan\Documents\Projects\SyncFLow\SyncFlow\Views\SettingsWindow.xaml
Line: 266
```

## Root Cause
The `&` character in the text "Import & Export" was not properly XML-escaped.

## Solution
Changed line 266 from:
```xml
Text="ðŸ“¤ Import & Export"
```

To:
```xml
Text="ðŸ“¤ Import &amp; Export"
```

## Explanation
In XML/XAML, the ampersand (`&`) is a special character that must be escaped as `&amp;` because it's used to denote entity references. Using an unescaped `&` causes the XML parser to expect an entity name to follow, which results in the "parsing EntityName" error.

## XML Special Characters
The following characters must be escaped in XML:
- `&` â†’ `&amp;`
- `<` â†’ `&lt;`
- `>` â†’ `&gt;`
- `"` â†’ `&quot;`
- `'` â†’ `&apos;`

## Verification
âœ… No diagnostics found in SettingsWindow.xaml
âœ… All other XAML files checked and verified
âœ… Build should now succeed

## Status
**FIXED** âœ…
